# purdue-AIMA-basic-pitch-testing

A repository containing Tim's testing of Basic Pitch.

The classical and jazz datasets are assembled from Prof. Yun's dataset and some of Tim's own songs (downloaded from OneDrive and yt5s.io). Currently, most or all of them refuse to be analyzed by Basic Pitch entirely due to a program crash.

The "Tim's songs" folder contains a few songs that Tim wrote/edited in previous months on his own. These passed through Basic Pitch just fine.
Each of these songs' folders contains four-ish things:
- The original MP3
- The MIDI stems of the original MP3 (only available because Tim made the songs)
- The Basic Pitch output MIDI file
- A MIDI file of all the MIDI notes played in the song with an electric piano (as well as an accompanying sound file), to serve as a comparison of the "perfect" output

The "Blind Composition Render" folder contains a "Further Experimentation" folder which contains different outputs from Basic Pitch at different settings.
